**Cosmic string detection from gravitational wave time strain data with machine learning.**

Due to its speed, machine learning can be used as a solution to a many problems faced in
gravitational-wave astronomy. Demonstrations have been given for various applications in
gravitational-wave data analysis. In this work, we focus on a challenging problem: The detection of
cosmic string signatures in time-domain gravitational wave data. Due to the capability of Machine
Learning techniques to recognize patterns, it is proposed that convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
can be an effective tool in the detection of cosmic strings. Here, we show a CNN architecture that
archives a 96% accuracy in distinguishing injected cosmic string data from background.
